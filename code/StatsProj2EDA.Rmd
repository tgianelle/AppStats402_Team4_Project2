```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Packages

```{r}
library(RCurl)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)
```
THe city of Framingham is concerned about the long term health of some of its citizens. In this exercise we will test probability models on a variety of factors that lead to coronary heart disease and recommend one solution.

## Load Data

```{r}
heartURL <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjwolfe91/AppStats402_Team4_Project2/master/data/framingham.csv")
heartData <- read.csv(text=heartURL, header=TRUE)
#heartData <- read.csv('C:/Users/micha/OneDrive/Desktop/SMU MSDS/Applied Stats/Project 2/Data/framingham.csv')
head(heartData)
```

Some of these data have categories that aren't particularly intuitive. Let's recode some of them.

## Rename columns

```{r recode}
#https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/recode.html

heartData$male = recode(heartData$male, '1' = 'male', '0' = 'female')
names(heartData)[1] = 'Gender'
unique(heartData$Gender)

heartData$education = recode(heartData$education, '1'='SomeHighSchool', '2'='FinishedHighSchool/GED',
       '3'='SomeCollege/VocationalSchool', '4'='College')
unique(heartData$education)

heartData$currentSmoker = recode(heartData$currentSmoker, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')
unique(heartData$currentSmoker)

heartData$BPMeds = recode(heartData$BPMeds, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')
unique(heartData$BPMeds)

unique(heartData$prevalentStroke)
heartData$prevalentStroke = recode(heartData$prevalentStroke, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')

unique(heartData$prevalentHyp)
heartData$prevalentHyp = recode(heartData$prevalentHyp, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')

unique(heartData$TenYearCHD)
heartData$TenYearCHD = recode(heartData$TenYearCHD, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')

unique(heartData$diabetes)
heartData$diabetes = recode(heartData$diabetes, '1'='Yes', '0'='No')
```

## EDA

## Column analysis and cleanup

Let's first confirm that our datatypes agree with the analysis we want to do.

```{r pairs}
sapply(heartData, class)
```

Those character columns would do better as factors, so let's change them.

```{r pairs}
cols_factor <- c("Gender", "education", "currentSmoker", "BPMeds", "prevalentStroke", "prevalentHyp", "diabetes", "TenYearCHD")
heartData[cols_factor] <- lapply(heartData[cols_factor], factor)
```

Now let's take some sums and summaries.

```{r}
numeric_cols <- subset(heartData, select = -c(Gender, education, currentSmoker, BPMeds, prevalentStroke, prevalentHyp, diabetes, TenYearCHD))
colSums(numeric_cols)
colSums(is.na(heartData))
summary(heartData)
```

Looks like there's some missing values in cigsPerDay, totChol, heartRate, and glucose. Let's see how much leverage these values have.

```{r}
dim(heartData)
dim(na.omit(heartData))
3658/4240
```

We can keep 86% of our values, so let's go ahead and remove these rows.

```{r}
heartData = na.omit(heartData)
dim(heartData)
summary(heartData)
```

Much better! However, it would be easier to interpret the model outcome as a person with _ is _ more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease, so let's adjust the response variable accordingly.

```{r}
levels(heartData$TenYearCHD)
heartData$TenYearCHD = relevel(heartData$TenYearCHD, ref='No')
```

## Continuous variables

Let's start by checking correlations.

```{r glucose}
aggregate(glucose~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=glucose)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Lots of outliers here. Hard to say if there is correlation because of this.

```{r heartrate}
aggregate(heartRate~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=heartRate)) + geom_boxplot()
```

No correlation here.

```{r BMI}
aggregate(BMI~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=BMI)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Looks like high BMI and heart disease might be correlated.

```{r diastolic BP}
aggregate(diaBP~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=diaBP)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Similarly appears that high diastolic BP correlates to ten year CHD.

```{r systolic BP}
aggregate(sysBP~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=sysBP)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Same with systolic BP.

```{r total cholesterol}
aggregate(totChol~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=totChol)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Again with cholesterol.

```{r cigarettes per day}
aggregate(cigsPerDay~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=cigsPerDay)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Yet again with cigarette use. Lots of outliers here too.

```{r age}
aggregate(age~TenYearCHD, data=heartData, summary)
ggplot(heartData, aes(x=TenYearCHD, y=age)) + geom_boxplot()
```

Higher age appears to be associated with CHD as well.

Let's run some histograms.

```{r histograms}
for (i in colnames(numeric_cols)){
  hist(heartData[[i]])
}
```

Mostly normally distributed with a couple exceptions. Now let's check mutlicolinearity and correlations.

```{r pairs correlation}
pairs(~ age + cigsPerDay + totChol + sysBP + diaBP + BMI + heartRate + glucose, data=heartData)
pairs(~ age + cigsPerDay + totChol + sysBP + diaBP + BMI + heartRate + glucose, data=heartData,
      col=TenYearCHD)
heartData.cor <- heartData %>% select(age, cigsPerDay, totChol, sysBP, diaBP, BMI, heartRate, glucose) %>%
  cor()
heartData.cor
heatmap.2(heartData.cor,col=redgreen(20), 
          density.info="none", trace="none", dendrogram=c("row"), 
          symm=F,symkey=T,symbreaks=T, scale="none")
```

There's a strong correlation between systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure...which makes practical sense considering they are essentially the same measure. Age does a good job of stratifying the variables and reducing multicollinearity. Two takeaways from this - first might be to remove either systolic or diastolic BP, second is to perhaps create interactions on the age variable.

## Categorical variables

Next let's check the categorical variables, first by measuring and plotting proportionality.

```{r diabetes}
attach(heartData)
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,diabetes),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~diabetes,col=c("red","blue"))
```

There appears to be an unbalanced response rate. We will need to keep this in mind when creating training data, and will likely necessitate a correction to the coefficient. It also appears that prevalent diabetes is associated with ten year CHD.

```{r prevalentHyp}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,prevalentHyp),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~prevalentHyp,col=c("red","blue"))
```

Again we see prevalent hypertension associated with ten year CHD.

```{r prevalentStroke}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,prevalentStroke),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~prevalentStroke,col=c("red","blue"))
```

Another association

```{r BPMeds}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,BPMeds),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~BPMeds,col=c("red","blue"))
```

Another association, and class imbalance

```{r currentSmoker}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,currentSmoker),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~currentSmoker,col=c("red","blue"))
```

Oddly appears that there is no association between smoking and ten year CHD

```{r education}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,education),2)
mosaicplot(TenYearCHD~education, las=1, main = 'Education vs Heart Disease')
```

Higher education appears to have lower rates of ten year CHD.

```{r gender}
prop.table(table(TenYearCHD,currentSmoker),2)
plot(TenYearCHD~Gender,col=c("red","blue"), las=1)
```

Males appear to develop CHD more often.

```{r ftables}
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$currentSmoker))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$Gender))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$education))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$BPMeds))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$prevalentStroke))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$prevalentHyp))) 
ftable(addmargins(table(heartData$TenYearCHD,heartData$diabetes)))
```

```{r ftables}
heartData_rm <- heartData[-c(diaBP)]
```
